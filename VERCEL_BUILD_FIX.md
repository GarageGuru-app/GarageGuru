# ðŸ”§ Vercel Build Configuration Fix

## Issue: "No output directory named dist found"

This happens because Vercel needs the correct build configuration for your project structure.

## âœ… **Correct Vercel Settings:**

### **Framework Detection:**
- **Framework Preset**: Vite âœ… 
- **Root Directory**: Leave EMPTY (not `client`) âœ…
- **Build Command**: `npm run build:client` âœ…
- **Output Directory**: `client/dist` âœ…

### **Why This Works:**
Your project has a monorepo structure where:
- Root `package.json` has the build commands
- `npm run build:client` builds the frontend
- Output goes to `client/dist` directory

### **Environment Variables:**
```
VITE_API_URL=https://garageguru-backend.onrender.com
```

### **Alternative if Above Doesn't Work:**
If Vercel still has issues, try:
- **Root Directory**: `client`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`

But you'll need to make sure `client/package.json` exists with the right scripts.

## **Redeploy Steps:**
1. Delete the failed deployment in Vercel
2. Re-import with the correct settings above
3. Deploy again

The build should complete successfully!
