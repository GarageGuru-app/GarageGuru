# ðŸš€ Separate Frontend & Backend Deployment

## Strategy: Deploy Separately for Maximum Reliability

### **Frontend (React)** â†’ Vercel
### **Backend (Express API)** â†’ Railway

---

## STEP 1: Prepare Frontend for Vercel

### 1.1 Configure API Base URL
We need to point the frontend to your deployed backend URL.

### 1.2 Build Frontend Only
The frontend will be a static site that calls your API.

## STEP 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

### 2.1 Why Railway?
- **Free tier available**
- **PostgreSQL database included**
- **Simple Express.js deployment**
- **Automatic HTTPS**
- **No serverless complexity**

### 2.2 Railway Setup Steps
1. Go to railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new project
4. Connect your repository
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy backend

---

## STEP 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### 3.1 Configure Frontend
Point React app to Railway backend URL

### 3.2 Vercel Deployment
1. Import repository to Vercel
2. Set build command to build only frontend
3. Deploy static site

## Benefits of This Approach:
âœ… **Simpler debugging** - Each part deploys independently
âœ… **Better reliability** - No serverless complexity
âœ… **Easier scaling** - Frontend on CDN, backend on dedicated server
âœ… **Clear separation** - Frontend and backend have distinct URLs
